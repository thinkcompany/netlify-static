# netlify-static

This static site is reference implementation of continuous deployment using Netlify.

Upon a merge to the `master` branch, this site is deployed to [netlify-static.netlify.com](https://netlify-static.netlify.com/)

Upon creation of any pull request, Netlify builds a [deploy preview](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) and deploys the site to an ephemeral URL.
